# Data Systems Project: Rijksmuseum G3

The rijksstudio is the online environment for the rijksmuseum. In this environment users can make collections and browse the collection of the rijksmuseum. There is a lot of information about the paintings present, but not on the location of objects that are in the paintings. To better locate these objects, we built a gamified system where users find objects in paintings.

## The overall system

The system contains many different sub systems (as seen below). The interactions with these systems are relativly simple as they mostly revolve around passing information between the frontend and the backend.

## Demonstration

To get a better understanding of how the final product functions this video gives a great demonstration of the features:

## How to run

Running the borders jupyter notebook file will launch the website. This will only work if you have downloaded the subset of paintings used in the project. To do this you need to run the painting scrape jupyter notebook. This file will download all the paintings into the correct folder and will allow the website to run properly.
