# Data Systems Project: Rijksmuseum G3

The rijksstudio is the online envioronment for the rijksmuseum. In this envioronment users can make collections and browse the collection of the rijksmuseum. There is a lot of information about the paintings present but not a lot of information on where objects are in the paintings. To better find this information we build a gamified system where users find objects in paintings.

## The overall system

The system contains many different sub systems (as seen below). The interactions with these systems are relativly simple as they mostly revolve around passing information between the frontend and the backend.

To get a better understanding of how the final product functions this video gives a great demonstration of the features:
